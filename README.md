# Lab-Website
My first website draft for any instituitional organisation is here!
Technologies used are listed below.
CSS: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the language we use to style an HTML document. CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed.
SCSS: Sassy CSS is more expressive. It uses less amount of lines in its code than CSS, which make the code load faster. It encourages proper nesting of rules â€“ standard CSS doesn't support nesting. We can't write a class inside another class.
HTML: HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. It describes the structure of a Web page.
JavaScript: It is the Programming Language for the Web. JS can update and change both HTML and CSS. It can calculate, manipulate and validate data.
